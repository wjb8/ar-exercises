# 1. Use Active Record's `create` class method multiple times to create 3 stores in the database:
#   * Burnaby (annual_revenue of 300000, carries men's and women's apparel)
#   * Richmond (annual_revenue of 1260000 carries women's apparel only)
#   * Gastown (annual_revenue of 190000 carries men's apparel only)
# 2. Output (`puts`) the number of the stores using ActiveRecord's `count` method, to ensure that there are three stores in the database.
# Your code goes below here ...

burnaby = Store.create(name: "Burnaby", annual_revenue: "300000", mens_apparel: true, womens_apparel: true)
richmond = Store.create(name: "Richmond", annual_revenue: "1260000", mens_apparel: false, womens_apparel: true)
gastown = Store.create(name: "Gastown", annual_revenue: "190000", mens_apparel: true, womens_apparel: false)

puts Store.count
